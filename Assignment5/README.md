WEB 250 Assignment 5
Valentina Biviano

Description: This project is a server-side application built with Node.js and Express. 
It demonstrates how to handle file uploads and process strings by reading the content 
of an uploaded text file and displaying it back to the web page.

What I learned: I learned how to use the multer middleware to handle multi-part form data 
and the fs (File System) module to read and stream file contents. Understanding how to 
manage the request-response cycle—specifically how the server processes an uploaded file 
and generates a dynamic HTML response was a very interesting experience.

I intend to apply this learning to reach my educational goal of mastering full-stack web 
development at Harper College
