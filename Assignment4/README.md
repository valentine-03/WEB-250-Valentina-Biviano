Assignment 4 – Server-Side Scripting

In this assignment I learned how server-side scripting works 
using conditions and loops. I created a Node.js script that 
processes GET requests and dynamically generates HTML content.
By using a loop, the page can display multiple results automatically, 
and with conditions it can decide what to show for each number. This 
helped me understand how dynamic web pages work instead of static HTML.
I plan to apply this in future web development projects where pages 
need to respond to user input and display different results.
