In this assignment, I learned how server-side scripting works using PHP and how it differs from static HTML pages. 
I practiced creating dynamic templates that display server information such as the current date and time, host name, 
IP address, operating system, and PHP version. I also learned how to link external CSS files to both static and 
dynamic pages, and how to structure a website so it works on a live server. I applied this learning by deploying my 
website to my InMotion hosting account, which helped me understand how web applications run in a real server environment. 
I can use these skills in future web development projects, both for educational purposes and potential career opportunities 
in creating functional, dynamic websites.
